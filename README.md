# RightMe

## About
1. A spell-checker and suggester app for English made during a college hackathon in February 2018.
2. The GUI was designed using PyQt5, and the app can be used by running the ***corrector.py*** file in the terminal.

## Working
1. A user would run the app after installing all the dependencies on his/her system.
2. When typing a word in the app, in case a spelling error occurs, the previous word would automatically be replaced by the best possible correct spelling.
3. The user can also select an option where instead of auto-correcting the current word, the interface would show a list of possible spelling suggestions. When a user selects a word of his/her choice from this suggestion box, the selected word would then be replaced in place of the previously typed-in incorrect spelling.
4. The spell-checking functionality in itself is provided by using an external library.
